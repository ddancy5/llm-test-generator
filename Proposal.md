# ðŸ“„ Project Proposal: AutoTest-LLM

## ðŸ§  Project Name
**AutoTest-LLM** â€“ Automated Test Case Generation using Large Language Models

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a software tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate a comprehensive set of software test cases from a provided codebase and a plain text specification file. This tool will simplify and accelerate the software testing process while maintaining high-quality coverage.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Scope

### ðŸ“¥ Input
- **1. Source Code Folder**: A complete project written in a single programming language (Python)
- **2. Specification File**: A `.txt` file containing detailed descriptions of each functionâ€™s expected behavior

### ðŸ“¤ Output
- A `Test Folder` containing the following:
  - **White-box Test Cases**:
    - Statement Coverage
    - Block Coverage
    - Condition Coverage
    - Path Coverage
  - **Black-box Test Cases**:
    - Derived from the textual specification
  - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** Test Cases
  - **Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)** Test Cases
  - **Automation Script**:
    - A GitHub Actions YAML workflow to automatically run the generated test suite

---

## ðŸ§ª Language Supported
- **Python**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Assumptions
- The input codebase is syntactically correct and functional
- The `.txt` specification file is complete, unambiguous, and maps to the functions in the codebase
- No dynamic code generation or obscure metaprogramming used in the source code

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core logic, parsing, and test generation
- **LLM API (OpenAI)**: To generate test cases using structured prompts
- **AST module (Python)**: For static code analysis and function extraction
- **GitHub Actions**: To automate the execution of generated test suites
- **Markdown & YAML**: For documentation and workflow configuration
